## Collaboration Rules & Workflow

### Development Principles
1. **Keep it simple** — Focus on MVP functionality, avoid overengineering
2. **Modular code** — Write clean, maintainable components
3. **Progressive enhancement** — Build core features first, then enhance
4. **User-first approach** — Prioritize usability and clarity

### Claude Code Responsibilities
- Follow the established roadmap phases in order
- Update this Development Log after every major task completion
- Explain important architectural decisions
- Suggest improvements while respecting MVP scope
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear

### Progress Tracking Protocol
After every code execution or major milestone:
1. Open `claude.md`
2. Update Development Log with:
   - ✅ What was completed
   - 📌 What's next
3. Mark roadmap items as complete when finished

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Next.js 13+ app directory structure
- Use ShadCN/UI components consistently
- Implement proper error handling
