## Critical Bug Fix - AnimatedCounter Infinite Loop (AGAIN!)

**Date:** 2025-09-02

⚠️ **RECURRING BUG ALERT:** The AnimatedCounter infinite loop bug has reappeared and was fixed again.

🔧 **Root Cause (same as before):**
- AnimatedCounter's useEffect had `displayValue` as a dependency in line 66
- This creates an infinite loop: useEffect updates `displayValue` → triggers effect again → exponential growth
- Bug is most visible when switching to projects with **0 subscriptions**

🛠️ **The Fix (applied again):**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG (causes infinite loop):
}, [value, duration, displayValue])

// ✅ CORRECT (fixed):
}, [value, duration])
```

📍 **File Location:** `src/components/ui/animated-counter.tsx:66`

📋 **Symptoms to watch for:**
- Numbers exponentially growing when switching between projects
- Most noticeable when switching to empty projects (0 subscriptions)
- Dashboard counters animating indefinitely instead of stopping

🚨 **IMPORTANT:** This is a React anti-pattern of using internal state (`displayValue`) as a useEffect dependency that updates that same state. If this bug reappears, immediately check line 66 of AnimatedCounter and remove `displayValue` from the dependency array.

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - AnimatedCounter now only triggers on `value` or `duration` changes
