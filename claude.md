- **Reproduction:** Bug only occurred when switching to projects with 0 subscriptions
- **Debugging Process:** Added comprehensive console logging to trace the issue through AnimatedCounter and dashboard
- **Solution Applied:** Removed `displayValue` from useEffect dependency array - now only triggers on `value` or `duration` changes
- **Result:** Project switching now works smoothly without exponential counter growth
- **Technical Impact:** Fixed React anti-pattern of using internal state as useEffect dependency that updates that same state
