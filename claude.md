# StackBill - SaaS Subscription Tracker

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**üö® DATABASE PROTECTION:** DO NOT EDIT the database structure in any way. Only interact with Supabase via MCP for READ operations. Any database schema changes must be explicitly requested and approved by the user first.

- Multi-project management system (many-to-many relationships)
- Renewal tracking with intelligent status indicators
- User authentication with GitHub OAuth + email/password
- Dark/light theme with multi-language support (English, Spanish, Italian)
- Professional email system with custom domain

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js + ShadCN/UI + Tailwind CSS

## üö® Critical Known Issues

### AnimatedCounter Infinite Loop Bug
‚ö†Ô∏è **RECURRING BUG:** AnimatedCounter infinite loop at `src/components/ui/animated-counter.tsx:66`

**Root Cause:** useEffect dependency includes `displayValue` which creates infinite loop
**Fix:** Remove `displayValue` from dependency array - use only `[value, duration]`
**Symptoms:** Numbers growing exponentially when switching between projects with 0 subscriptions

## üìß Email System Status

### Current Implementation: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Professional email templates:** Account confirmation, renewal alerts, monthly summaries, cancellation/goodbye emails
- **Test endpoints:** `/api/test-renewal-email` and `/api/test-summary-email` for development
- **Email collection system:** Team plan notification signup with database integration
- **Template development system:** Interactive preview at `email-preview.html`

### Outstanding Email Tasks:
‚ùå **Production Template Update:** Enhanced designs in preview system need to be transferred to `/src/lib/resend.ts`
- Beautiful professional templates created in preview but not yet applied to production emails
- Logo implementation, improved styling, and content structure ready for deployment

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Test renewal alerts
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-renewal-email -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId": "YOUR_USER_ID"}'

# Test monthly summary  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-summary-email -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId": "YOUR_USER_ID"}'
```
