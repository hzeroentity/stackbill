        "question": "How does billing work?",

      "cancelDowngrade": {
        "question": "Can I cancel or downgrade anytime?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can cancel your Pro subscription anytime with no penalty. When you downgrade, your subscription is immediately canceled but you keep Pro access until the end of your current billing period. After that, you'll be moved to the free plan automatically."

        "question": "What happens to my data if I downgrade?",

        ]
      },
      "emailNotifications": {
        "question": "How do email notifications work?",
        "answer": "Pro users receive automatic email notifications to help manage their subscriptions. You'll get renewal alerts 7, 3, and 1 days before subscriptions renew, plus monthly summary emails with spending insights. All emails include unsubscribe options and you can customize preferences in your settings."
      },
      "paymentSecurity": {
        "question": "Is my payment information secure?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. All payments are processed through Stripe, one of the world's most trusted payment processors. We never store your credit card information on our servers. Stripe is PCI DSS Level 1 certified and used by millions of businesses worldwide, including Twitter, Lyft, and Shopify."
      },
      "deleteAccount": {
        "question": "Can I delete my account completely?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can permanently delete your StackBill account anytime from your settings page. This will immediately cancel any active subscription, delete all your data from our servers, and send you a farewell email. Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone."
      },
      "refunds": {
        "question": "Do you offer refunds?",
        "answer": "Since StackBill Pro is a low-cost monthly service, we generally don't offer refunds. However, if you're experiencing technical issues or have concerns about your billing, please contact our support team at hello@stackbill.dev and we'll work with you to find a solution."
