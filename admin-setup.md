# üîí Simple & Secure Admin Setup with 2FA

## Step 1: Run Database Schema

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
2. Open the file `migrations/004_simple_secure_admin.sql`
3. **FIRST**, get your user ID by running:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'filippo@miralmedia.it';
   ```
4. Copy your user ID from the result
5. Replace `YOUR_USER_ID_HERE` in the migration file with your actual user ID
6. Run the complete migration

## Step 2: Verify Setup

After running the migration, verify your admin access:

```sql
-- Check if you're properly set up as admin
SELECT 
  au.*,
  u.email 
FROM admin_user au 
JOIN auth.users u ON au.user_id = u.id 
WHERE u.email = 'filippo@miralmedia.it';
```

You should see your admin record with `is_active = true`.

## Step 3: Test Admin Access

1. Logout and login again to refresh your session
2. Visit `/admin` - you should now have access
3. Check browser console for any errors

## Step 4: Setup 2FA (Required for Security)

After accessing the admin dashboard:

1. **Visit `/admin`** - you'll see a 2FA setup section
2. **Click "Setup Two-Factor Authentication"**
3. **Scan QR code** with Google Authenticator app
4. **Save backup codes** in a secure location
5. **Enter verification code** to enable 2FA
6. **Done!** Your admin account is now secured with 2FA

## Security Features Implemented

### üõ°Ô∏è **Production Security**
- ‚úÖ **Database-stored admin access** (not email-based)
- ‚úÖ **2FA with Google Authenticator** (TOTP + backup codes)
- ‚úÖ **Session management** with 24-hour expiration
- ‚úÖ **Account lockout** after 5 failed attempts (30min)
- ‚úÖ **Complete audit logging** with IP tracking

### üîê **Two-Factor Authentication**
- **TOTP Support**: Works with Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
- **Backup Codes**: 8 single-use backup codes for emergencies
- **Session Tracking**: 2FA verification logged with timestamps
- **Account Recovery**: Emergency 2FA disable via database if needed

### üìä **Security Logging**
All admin actions are tracked:
- Login attempts (successful & failed)
- Dashboard access with IP/browser info
- 2FA setup, enable, disable events
- Session extensions and expirations
- Failed authentication attempts

## Adding Future Admins (If Needed)

Since this system is designed for a single admin, you typically won't need this. But if you ever need to add another admin:

```sql
-- Add another admin directly via database
INSERT INTO admin_user (user_id, is_active) 
VALUES (
  'new-admin-user-id-from-auth-users',
  true
);
```

**Steps:**
1. User creates account via normal signup
2. Get their user ID from `auth.users` table
3. Insert them into `admin_user` table
4. They'll need to setup their own 2FA

## Session Management

- **Session Duration**: 24 hours (automatically extended on activity)
- **Session Expiry**: Automatic logout when session expires
- **IP Tracking**: All admin access is logged with IP addresses
- **User Agent Logging**: Device/browser information stored

## Security Log Queries

```sql
-- View recent admin activity
SELECT 
  sl.*,
  u.email
FROM admin_security_log sl
JOIN auth.users u ON sl.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY sl.created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- View failed login attempts
SELECT * FROM admin_security_log 
WHERE success = false 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View 2FA events
SELECT * FROM admin_security_log 
WHERE action LIKE '%2fa%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View recent logins
SELECT * FROM admin_security_log 
WHERE action = 'admin_verification'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Security Recommendations

1. **Setup 2FA immediately** after running migration (required!)
2. **Enable 2FA on GitHub** account (your login method)
3. **Save backup codes** in a secure password manager
4. **Monitor security logs** regularly for suspicious activity
5. **Use HTTPS only** in production
6. **Keep backup codes secure** - store offline if possible

## Troubleshooting

### "Access denied - Admin privileges required"
1. Check if your user ID is correctly inserted in `admin_user` table
2. Verify `is_active = true` and session hasn't expired
3. Clear browser cache and re-login

### 2FA Issues
- **Can't scan QR code**: Make sure you have Google Authenticator installed
- **Invalid token**: Check your device time is synchronized
- **Lost authenticator**: Use one of your backup codes
- **Lost backup codes**: Contact support or disable 2FA via database

### Emergency 2FA Disable
```sql
-- Only use in emergency - disables 2FA for your account
UPDATE admin_user 
SET totp_enabled = false, totp_secret = null, backup_codes = '[]' 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

## Production Checklist

- ‚úÖ **Database schema deployed** (`admin_user` + `admin_security_log`)
- ‚úÖ **Admin user created** with active status
- ‚úÖ **2FA system working** with QR codes and backup codes
- ‚úÖ **Session management** with 24-hour expiration
- ‚úÖ **Security logging** with IP/browser tracking
- ‚úÖ **Account lockout** after failed attempts
- ‚úÖ **API endpoints secured** with proper validation
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** and user feedback

Your admin system is now **production-ready** with bank-level security! üöÄ

**Next step**: Run the migration and setup 2FA immediately.
